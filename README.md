A WordPress plugin that adds a "featured" or "buried" CSS class and meta value to selected comments.

## Description

This is an updated fork of the seemingly-abandoned "Featured Comments" plugin by Pippins Plugins, which itself seems to be a fork of a plugin called "Easy Featured Comments".

Lets the admin add "featured" or "buried" CSS class and meta value to selected comments. Handy to highlight comments that add value to your post.

Also includes a widget for showing recently featured comments.

## Installation

There are two ways to install from GitHub:

### ZIP Download

If you have downloaded this plugin as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository, do the following to install it:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the plugin's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/plugins/feature-comments`
2. Activate the plugin.
3. You're done.

### git clone

If you have cloned the code from GitHub, it is assumed that you know what you're doing.
