## Description

Lets the admin add "featured" or "buried" css class to selected comments. Handy to highlight comments that add value to your post.

This plugin makes use of the meta_query option added in WordPress 3.5 to the WP_Comment_Query class, so it is no longer compatible with earlier versions of WordPress.

## Installation

### ZIP Download

If you have downloaded this plugin as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository, do the following to install it:

2. Activate the plugin.
